# Portfolio Website
This is the source code for my portfolio website made in Next.JS back in 2021, I've made some edits to make it somewhat up to date, and updated most dependencies to recent versions. Feel free to fork this repo and edit it to match your needs.

### Running it locally

First, install all the dependencies using npm:

    npm install

Then, run the development server:

    npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the website locally.
